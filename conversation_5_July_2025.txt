It includes methods for logging setup, model invocation, continuation logic, conversation summarization, workflow creation, system message loading, vector memory updates, chat functionality, and file reading and chunking.

7. **Chat Functionality and Conversation Management**: The `chat` method handles interactions with the language model, retrieving relevant memory, and constructing responses. The `conversation` method provides a simple interface for message exchange, maintaining a conversation history and updating vector memory.

8. **File Reading and Chunking**: The `read_own_source_code` method processes files in chunks, updating conversation history, and summarizing memory. It prompts the agent for a final summary after multiple passes, demonstrating the agent's ability to handle large text inputs.

9. **Interactive Capabilities**: The agent supports interactive sessions, allowing users to engage in conversations and receive real-time responses. Sample conversation items include asking for names, preferences, and weather information, as well as storing user preferences like liking the Celtics or the Patriots.

10. **Exception Handling**: The code includes mechanisms to handle exceptions during interactions, providing insights and potential solutions.

Overall, the `basic_agent.py` file defines a robust framework for my operation as an agent, enabling me to interact with users, manage conversations, and utilize tools to provide informed and relevant responses. The `AgentManager` class plays a central role in orchestrating these functionalities, ensuring that I can interact with the language model effectively and manage the conversation flow.
Enter a message to the agent: Hi there Bob, let's recap the things we discussed last time around and when we discussed them!
Agent response: During our last conversation, we covered a variety of topics. Here's a recap of what we discussed and when:

1. **U.S. Political History**:
   - We talked about the Federalist Party, John Quincy Adams' association with them, and his presidency, including the election of 1824 and the "corrupt bargain."
   - We discussed the Democratic-Republican Party, its fracturing during Adams' presidency, and the trajectories of the Republican and Democratic parties, the Whig Party, and their roles during the Civil War.
   - We explored strict and loose constructionist interpretations and the Whig Party's stance.

2. **P vs NP Problem**:
   - We discussed the barriers to proving P = NP or P != NP, including the role of relativizing proofs and oracles.
   - We talked about the implications of one-way functions and their impact on proving P != NP.
   - We mentioned the work of Baker, Gill, and Solovay, as well as Impagliazzo and Rudich, in relation to these barriers.

3. **Car Maintenance**:
   - You mentioned taking your Honda Accord in for an oil change and receiving a clean bill of health from the mechanic.
   - We also talked about your car's tire pressures and tread depth being in good condition.
   - Later, you mentioned a check engine light issue due to a loose gas cap, which was resolved after tightening it.

These discussions took place over a couple of sessions, with the most recent one occurring on June 22, 2025. If you have any more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!
Enter a message to the agent: Thanks Bob!  I have a problem.  Check engine came on all over again.  I thoguht it was my gas cap so I tightened it back up after refueling expecting it to go out after two or three drives, but it won't go out.
Agent response: I'm sorry to hear that the check engine light has come on again. While a loose gas cap is a common cause, there could be other reasons why the light remains on. Here are a few steps you can take:

1. **Double-Check the Gas Cap**: Ensure that the gas cap is tightly secured and that there are no cracks or damage to the cap itself. Sometimes, a faulty gas cap can cause the light to stay on.

2. **Drive Cycle**: After tightening the gas cap, it may take a few drive cycles for the light to reset. A drive cycle typically involves starting the car, driving at various speeds, and then turning it off. If the light doesn't go off after a few cycles, there may be another issue.

3. **Check for Other Issues**: If the gas cap isn't the problem, there could be other issues such as a faulty oxygen sensor, catalytic converter, or mass airflow sensor. These components can trigger the check engine light if they malfunction.

4. **Diagnostic Scan**: Consider taking your car to a mechanic or an auto parts store that offers free diagnostic scans. They can use an OBD-II scanner to read the error codes from your car's computer, which will help identify the specific issue.

5. **Professional Inspection**: If you're unable to resolve the issue, it's best to have a professional mechanic inspect your car. They can diagnose and fix the problem to ensure your vehicle is running safely and efficiently.

Enter a message to the agent: Thanks Bob.  Do you remember my name?
Agent response: Yes, I remember your name is John. If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!
Enter a message to the agent: Good.  Just verifying memory over the conversations.  Let me pose a logic problem here.  A implies C.  D is true.  What's the value of A?
Agent response: In logic, if we have the statement "A implies C" (A → C), it means that if A is true, then C must also be true. However, if A is false, C can be either true or false.

Given that "D is true," this information does not directly affect the relationship between A and C, as D is a separate statement. Therefore, without additional information about C or a direct relationship between D and A or C, we cannot determine the truth value of A based solely on the information provided.

In summary, the truth value of A cannot be determined from the given statements "A implies C" and "D is true" without more information about C or a connection between D and the other statements.
Enter a message to the agent: Ok, I will add a third premise.  C xor D.  Can you figure out A now?
Agent response: With the additional premise "C xor D," we can analyze the situation further. The "xor" (exclusive or) operation means that either C is true or D is true, but not both.

Given:
1. A implies C (A → C)
2. D is true
3. C xor D

From the "C xor D" premise and knowing that D is true, we can deduce that C must be false (since both C and D cannot be true simultaneously).

Now, let's revisit the implication "A implies C" (A → C):
- If A is true, then C must be true. However, we have determined that C is false.
- Therefore, A cannot be true because it would lead to a contradiction (A being true would require C to be true, which it is not).

Thus, A must be false.
Enter a message to the agent: Good.  I'm verifying that you know when your knowledge is insufficient and that you know when you have enoug knowledge to figure out an answer.  This is a check on your knowledge of your own knowledge state.
Agent response: Thank you for verifying my ability to assess when I have sufficient information to provide an answer. It's important for me to recognize the limits of my knowledge and to communicate clearly when additional information is needed to reach a conclusion. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
Enter a message to the agent: How would I stop a conversation with you?  I've forgotten...
Agent response: To stop a conversation with me, you can simply enter the command "/stop" during our interactive session. This command is recognized by the `main_loop` function in my source code, which is responsible for managing the interactive session. Once you enter "/stop", the loop will set a `stop_flag` to `True`, breaking the loop and effectively ending the conversation. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
Enter a message to the agent: Great!  You understand your own source code and your knowledge state.  So you know things about your own structure as well as your own knowledge state.
Agent response: Thank you, John! Yes, I am designed to understand my own source code and to be aware of my knowledge state. This allows me to effectively manage conversations, assess when I have enough information to provide an answer, and recognize when additional information is needed. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
Enter a message to the agent: /stop
